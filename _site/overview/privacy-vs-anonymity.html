title: Privacy vs Anonymity
permalink: /overview/privacy-vs-anonymity.html</p>

<p>Itâ€™s important when using these tools to communicate with others to be aware of both your privacy and anonymity, and to recognise the difference.</p>

<p>Privacy is the ability to keep information to yourself, or share in confidence with others. Encryption tools offer this ability to keep prying eyes out of the information you want to keep secret.</p>

<p>Anonymity is the ability to communicate with others while keeping your identity a secret, using pseudonyms. Tools like Tor offer the ability to mask your browsing identity in such a way as to be anonymous.</p>
