## PGP - Pretty Good Privacy

Pretty Good Privacy (more commonly referred to as PGP) is a means of using public key crytography to communicate securely. PGP is most commonly used in email clients to encrypt email communications.

The [Electronic Frontier Foundation (EFF)](https://eff.org) maintains a wealth of documentation on using privacy cryptography tools, written with a non technical audience in mind.

Instead of recreating their amazing work, this guide instead serves to direct you to the best documentation available which is more comprehensive than the material that we'll cover in this workshop.

### Using PGP on Windows

Using PGP on Windows requires the installation of some extra software packages, as well as the use of a particular email client called Thunderbird. Thunderbird is a Free and Open Source alternative email client, similar to the likes of Outlook.

You can find the EFF's documentation on installing and configuring this software [here](https://ssd.eff.org/en/module/how-use-pgp-windows-pc)
