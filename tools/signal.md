Signal – Private Messenger is a free and open source software application for iPhone that employs end-to-end encryption, allowing users to send end-to-end encrypted group, text, picture, and video messages and have encrypted phone conversations between Signal users on iPhone and TextSecure or RedPhone users on Android.  Although Signal uses telephone numbers as contacts, calls and messages actually use your data connection; therefore both parties to the conversation must have Internet access on their mobile devices.  Due to this, Signal users don’t incur SMS and MMS fees.
